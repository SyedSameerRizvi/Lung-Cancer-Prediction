# Lung Cancer Prediction

This project is focused on the recognition and classification of traffic signs using machine learning techniques. The model is designed to identify various traffic signs based on image data, making it useful for applications in autonomous driving and traffic management systems.

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to develop a model capable of accurately classifying traffic signs. This model can help in creating more robust navigation and driving systems by accurately recognizing road signs.

## Dataset
The effectiveness of cancer prediction system helps the people to know their cancer risk with low cost and it also helps the people to take the appropriate decision based on their cancer risk status. The data is collected from the website online lung cancer prediction system .
